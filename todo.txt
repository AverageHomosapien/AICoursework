pull out x and y coordinates from the final cave and find the distance with the euclidean distance

Cave 3 ends at cave 2?
	DOES IT NEED TO MAP THE FINAL CAVE?
	NEEDS TO SET ACTIVE CAVE AS FINAL CAVE AND UPDATE UI ACCORDINGLY

Add a completed variable - need to clear canvas (reset canvas) before you go again

EXTRA:
	turn active lines and active caves red
