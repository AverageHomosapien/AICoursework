TO DO:

Make sure that program doesn't crash with a wrong file path or wrong filename
Check for previous locations search has been to - stop the search from revisiting nodes

DEAD END CODE ONLY GOES BACK UP ONE LEVEL - POSSIBILITY FOR INFINITE LOOP

3 in infinite loop (because therre's no finish to node)
